  <p>Welcome to my homepage!</p>
  <p>As a recent Computer Engineering graduate from <a href="https://www.columbia.edu/">Columbia University</a>, I am currently expanding my skill set by pursuing a Master's in Applied Analytics. My passion for technology and entrepreneurship has been shaped by internships at two startups, which inspired me to embark on my own entrepreneurial journey.</p>
<p>Founding Xeward has been a privilege, allowing me to work on projects that align with my interests. One notable venture is <a href="https://www.surgg.io">Surgg</a>, a real-time entertainment news app that delivers minute-sized videos summarizing live rankings of keywords on Google Trends. As the sole developer and first-time product manager, I learned valuable lessons that led to discussions with renowned investors, including 500 Global, Sequoia (Peak XV), Entrepreneur First, and others. Surgg's potential was also recognized by <a href="https://nyweekly.com/tech/surgg-real-time-video-coverage-of-trending-google-searches-bringing-you-breaking-news-before-it-hits-the-headlines/">New York Weekly</a>.</p>
<p>Additionally, I've worked on other exciting projects, such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrwDNr9MO9hzhXWuMcaj1jA" target="\_blank">MuseMate</a>, an AI-powered docent for museums, and <a href="https://apkpure.com/%EB%91%A5%EC%8A%A4%ED%84%B0-%E2%80%93-%EC%8B%A4%EC%8B%9C%EA%B0%84-%EB%B0%98%EB%A0%A4%EA%B2%AC-%EC%82%B0%EC%B1%85-%EC%9A%B0%EB%A6%AC%EB%8F%99%EB%84%A4-%EC%86%8C%EC%85%9C%EC%9D%98-%EC%8B%9C%EC%9E%91/com.xeward.doongster" target="\_blank">Doongster</a>, a dog walking app. I am eager to continue <a href="https://github.com/JasonHJJin/etc" target="_blank">learning and contributing to innovative projects</a>.</p>
